## EDIMA
Edima is a project of image edition, "EDIition IMAges", where I try to build a PyQT6 interface that can edit images. 

Here I practice how to build an interactive interface with python, and apply the formulas that I learned in the assignment of Digital Images into a usable project. 

### GUI_Imagery 
GUI_Imagery is the main program that must be executed to see the python interface. Inside there is the whole structure of the pyQT interface.
If you run the file, the program will automatically open and then you can already interact with it.
